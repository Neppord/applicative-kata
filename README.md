# Applicative exercise

## Connect

Take a look at [id.kt](src/main/kotlin/id.kt) what tests would you need to write in order to makesure that the implementations for `id` and `intId` respectively returns the argument unaltered?

## Concept

Functors

## Concrete

Implement the functions in the files, in this order:
 * [id.kt](src/main/kotlin/id.kt)
 * [function.kt](src/main/kotlin/function.kt)
 * [pair.kt](src/main/kotlin/pair.kt)

## Conclude

Why is it usefull to know about the functor pattern? How can designing your types affect the amount of tests you need to write?

## Connect

Have you any more examples of Functors, and could you identify any of them in your codebase?

## Concept

Applicatives

## Concrete
Implement the functions in the files, in this order:
 * [list.kt](src/main/kotlin/list.kt)
 * [parser.kt](src/main/kotlin/parser.kt)
